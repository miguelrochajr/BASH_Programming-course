# BASH_Programming-course
This repository has the files I produced while going through the course BASH Programming by Ermin Kreponic (https://goo.gl/Wj9Sg2)

### IMPORTANT for macOS users!
  If you want an easy way to get a newer version of bash, use brew. find it by searching homebrew mac. (or go to http://brew.sh)
then just run:
>brew install bash

in your scripts, you can then put at the top of your scripts:

>#!/usr/local/bin/bash
