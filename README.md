# BASH_Programming-course
This repository has the files I produced while going through the course BASH Programming by Ermin Kreponic (https://goo.gl/Wj9Sg2)

>>>>> IMPORTANT FOR macOS USERS!

if you want an easy way to get a newer version of bash, use brew. find it by searching homebrew mac. (or go to http://brew.sh)

then just run:

brew install bash

in your scripts, you can then put at the top of your scripts:

#!/usr/local/bin/bash

NOTE: Homebrew (or just brew) is free and can be educational.
