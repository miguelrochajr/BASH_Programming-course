# BASH_Programming-course
This repository has the files I produced while going through the course BASH Programming by Ermin Kreponic (https://goo.gl/Wj9Sg2)

#### IMPORTANT FOR macOS USERS!

Some commands taught through the course were meant for bash version 4. However, macOS has the version 3.2.57(1). So, you should install
the newest version of bash.
If you want an easy way to get a newer version of it, use brew. find it by searching homebrew mac. (or go to http://brew.sh)

then just run:
>brew install bash

in your scripts, you can then put at the top of your scripts:

>#!/usr/local/bin/bash
